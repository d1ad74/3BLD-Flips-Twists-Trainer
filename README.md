# 3BLD Flips & Twists Trainer

http://fliptrainer.maxsiauw.com/

I set out to develop this tool because I wanted a way to practice *harder* scrambles for 3x3 blindfolded--that is, scrambles with edge flips and corner twists. I especially need to work on breaking into edge flips and solving 3-twists using two commutators (as opposed to two two-twists). 

This web app allows you to **select a desired number of edge flips and/or corner twists**, and it will generate normal 3x3 blindfolded scrambles with the number of flips/twists you set. With the "Generate Scrambles" button in the bottom right, you can also generate scrambles that you can input directly into csTimer to practice from there. 

For more in-depth instructions, see https://youtu.be/_dNoFsD36Iw

Hope you all find this helpful! Please reach out with any questions/suggestions/etc!
